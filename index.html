									<h2><a href="https://github.com/nwalablessing">Research Interest</a></h2>
<p>
My research interests lie at the intersection of data science, machine learning, cybersecurity, and applied digital forensics. I am particularly drawn to the development of intelligent systems that leverage real-time data for predictive modeling and decision support, especially in high-impact domains such as healthcare, agriculture, and infrastructure. This includes the design of robust machine learning frameworks for clinical risk monitoring and environmental intelligence, as well as the implementation of interpretable models using Python, XGBoost, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the area of digital forensics and cybersecurity, I am focused on the use of memory analysis, registry inspection, and packet forensics to detect and reconstruct advanced persistent threats (APTs) and network-based attacks. My work in this field includes system-level investigations using tools such as Autopsy,MagnetAxiom SleuthKit, Volatility, Splunk, and Wireshark to trace malware behavior, uncover digital artifacts, and document incident timelines. I also explore network security from a forensics-first perspective investigating DNS tunneling, phishing vectors, and protocol anomalies to understand attacker behavior and enhance intrusion detection systems. Additionally, I have a growing interest in environmental analytics, where I apply geospatial tools such as QGIS and Google Earth Engine to assess chemical distribution and ecological risk in wetland areas. This work involves satellite data processing, land use classification, and spatial modeling to inform environmental decision-making. I am also deeply interested in embedded system applications, particularly in developing assistive technologies and remote monitoring devices using fuzzy logic, microcontrollers, and real-time sensors for field-based automation. Collectively, my research is driven by a desire to integrate data engineering, intelligent algorithms, and security-first design to build systems that are not only technically robust but also socially impactful.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/nwalablessing/streamlit-health-monitor">Real-Time Sepsis Prediction System and Patient Monitoring<br />
										</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://nubsepsis.streamlit.app/" class="image fit"><img src="images/sepsis.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, I designed a scalable, real-time sepsis prediction system that integrates machine learning with wearable technology for early ICU risk detection. Using Python and XGBoost, I trained the model on the PhysioNet Sepsis Challenge dataset, applying SMOTE for class balancing and normalization for consistent feature scaling. The final model achieved 97.67% accuracy with an AUC of 0.83. The best-performing model was serialized and saved as a .pkl file for seamless deployment. The system collects heart rate data from Amazfit Bip 5 smartwatches through Zepp and Strava APIs and displays dynamic risk predictions via a Streamlit web interface. Telegram bot supports medication alerts and clinician-patient communication. This end-to-end solution enables proactive sepsis detection, real-time monitoring, and faster ICU interventions through AI-powered clinical decision support.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/nwalablessing/Adaptive-Color-Quantization">Adaptive Color Quantization for Efficient Image Compression Using Convolutional Autoencoders<br />
										</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjBLIFFM8ZE" class="image fit"><img src="images/autoencoder.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I developed an adaptive image compression system using convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to dynamically adjust color quantization based on image complexity. The model was trained on the CIFAR-100 dataset and achieved a balance between high compression efficiency and perceptual image quality, with a PSNR of 26.09 and an SSIM of 0.8558. Unlike traditional quantization methods like K-means, which apply uniform compression, my approach uses region-specific adjustments to preserve detail in complex areas while minimizing redundancy in simpler regions. The system architecture includes normalization, encoding, a latent bottleneck layer, decoding, and an evaluation module. Visualization tools like t-SNE and error distribution plots were used to validate the latent space organization and reconstruction performance. The model training and testing process was automated end-to-end, with final deployment potential for use in resource-constrained environments. This work demonstrates how deep learning can significantly improve the adaptability and visual fidelity of image compression systems.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Splunk-Based Cybersecurity Lab<br />
										</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/splunk.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I built a virtual cybersecurity lab using Splunk SIEM to simulate and investigate real-world cyberattacks. Using Kali Linux tools such as Nmap, I generated a series of reconnaissance and scanning events, configured multiple log sources, and used Splunk to detect, correlate, and visualize the attack patterns. I developed alerting rules, analyzed system and network logs, and produced structured incident reports detailing detection timelines, potential impact, and remediation steps. This hands-on lab demonstrated the use of SIEM tools for proactive threat detection, real-time security analytics, and end-to-end incident response.</p>

										</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/nwalablessing/Digital-Forensics-Analysis-Projects-" class="image fit"><img src="images/registry.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I conducted a series of digital forensic investigations focusing on Windows registry analysis, memory forensics, and deleted file recovery. Using tools such as Autopsy, SleuthKit, Volatility, and Foremost, I examined NTFS and FAT file systems, recovered user activity timelines, and carved data from formatted drives. The analysis included registry hive inspection, MACB timestamp tracking, encrypted container evaluation, and GPS metadata extraction from multimedia artifacts. These investigations replicated real-world forensic scenarios involving policy violations, digital evidence reconstruction, and incident reporting demonstrating proficiency in end-to-end forensic methodology across system layers.</p>

									<p>This project involved a series of hands-on cybersecurity investigations simulating real-world attack scenarios, using tools such as Wireshark, Snort, tcpdump, aircrack-ng, and Python. I conducted packet-level forensics on malicious JPEG payloads flagged by Snort alerts, performed threat validation via VirusTotal, and reconstructed exploitation timelines through PCAP analysis. Investigations included DNS tunneling detection, email-based malware delivery, cross-site scripting recovery, and WEP key decryption. By tracing activity across the OSI model and correlating artifacts from Squid logs, hex editors, and base64-encoded payloads, I developed full attacker profiles and incident reports demonstrating deep technical skill in threat detection, evidence recovery, and network defense analysis.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/nwalablessing/enhanced-smart-stick-for-visually-impaired" class="image fit"><img src="images/Walking.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As part of my undergraduate final year project, I co-developed a sensor-based navigation aid designed to help visually impaired individuals detect obstacles and water hazards more effectively. The system was built using an Arduino Mega 2560, dual ultrasonic sensors, a water sensor, and a vibration motor to provide real-time haptic feedback. We achieved a 94% detection accuracy through rigorous indoor and outdoor testing. This low-cost solution enhances user awareness, safety, and independence, especially for individuals in low-income environments where assistive technologies like guide dogs are inaccessible. The project was developed as a two-person team and inspired by a desire to make daily navigation safer and more autonomous for the visually impaired.</p>
